Work on your speed &amp; learn common coding conventions for all sorts of JavaScript.

Notes for Alyce:

- Fork this repository, and then clone your fork into VS-Code.
- Create & checkout into a new branch in git
- `git checkout -b typing/alyce/1`
- Split your screen side-by-side for convenience
- For each example file, create a new typing file like below in the VS-Code terminal.
- `Ctrl ~` (two tries potentially)
- `touch training-filename-number.js` 
- example: `touch training-stripe-3.js` (or) || (or) `touch training-serverless-1.yml`
- Some of the files you will type out three times, sometimes just once or twice - depends on length, usefulness.
- Send a pull-request to the develop branch for the central repository of the repo you forked (in other words, the original).
